# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
A proposal has been made to bring Citi Bikes to Des Moines, IA. To help convince potential investors of its success we did a thorough analysis of Citi Bikes in New York City utilizing data visualizations in Tableau Public to share. We focused on the month of August and used data from the year 2019.

### Top Starting Locations

In the above image, what we are looking at is the top starting locations where bikers begin their trips. The bigger and darker the circle, the more popular of a spot it is. After doing some research, it appears that most of these top spots are in prime areas where there is shopping, attractions, parks, or an entertainment area. We can definitely assume a heavy amount of tourist are using these bikes in these areas.

### August Peak Hours

The above image reflects the peak hours during the month of August using a 24-hour clock. Peak hours are definitely more distinguished during rush hour, especially during the work release period. During the early hours between 1AM - 4AM is the slowest period and would be a good time frame to consider doing bike maintenance.

### Checkout Times for Users

In this visualization we are displaying the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. 

### Checkout Times by Gender

This graph is similar to the previous graph but now we are breaking it down based on gender. As it shows there are more males checking out the bikes that females.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour

Here we graphed the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap. The results are similar to our August Peak Hours bar chart in that it reflects there being more use around rush hour. For an unknown reason, Thursday is the busiest day of the week. 

### Trips by Gender (Weekday Per Hour)

Now we are breaking down the previous graph based on gender. The patterns are very similar, but of course there is more activity on the male heatmap which makes sense as we learned from our Checkout Times by Gender graph men are using the Citi Bikes the most. 

### User Trips by Bender by Weekday

Finally. we have broken down the previous graph based on customers and subscribers. It looks like the subscribers are definitely taking advantage of their memberships and using the Citi Bikes the most! Males seem to make up most of the subscribers as well. 

## Summary
What have we learned? 
  - Many of the start locations are based around areas where there is shopping, attractions, parks, or an entertainment area. Let us make sure we effectively use this same strategy for station placements in Des Moines. 
  - Peak times of usage are during the work commute hours. We need to make sure we have the right amount of bikes to offer during these key time frames. 
  - It seems that most of the use is for getting from point A to point B and not for a joy ride. 
  - Males definitely take advantage of the Citi Bikes the most and use them more often. Based on census data the male and female ratios are about 50/50 in Des Moines. 
  - Subscribers take advantage of Citi Bikes the most. Let us make sure we promote the benefits of a subscription to citizens in Des Moines.

Two additional visualization suggestions:
  1. Weather can obviously be a factor for bike usage. If we could obtain the data, we might want to compare the usage vs precipitation. 
  2. We just looked at the month of August so it would definitely be a good idea to compare usage during the entire year, as it would probably slow down during the winter months.
